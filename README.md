# A modern tic-tac-toe game built in HTML5, CSS, Javascript/jQuery

##Summary:
This game was built using semantic HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. The objective was to design and develop a modernized version of the standard tic-tac-toe game, using minimalist design and subtle animation to make for what I hope will provide a delightful user experience. 


### Styling:
I chose a minimalist design style, with some nice typography from the generous people over at Google. The specific typeface I chose is a modern serif called [Unica One](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Unica+One).

### Planning:
Here is some of the initial design and documentation that went into building the game.

#### Future Consideration:
For duture iterations I'm hoping to refactor some of the code, possibly coupling the player objects using contructor functions. I would also like to allow users to be able to choose their color in the future, and possibly add some more animation to make for a more dynamic experience.

I hope you enjoy
